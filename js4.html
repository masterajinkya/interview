            <h5>64 What is output of number + boolean? </h5>
            <b>Ans:</b>
            <p>When you use the <code>+</code> operator to add a number and a boolean in JavaScript, JavaScript performs
                type coercion to convert the boolean value to its numeric equivalent. In JavaScript, <code>true</code>
                is equivalent to <code>1</code>, and <code>false</code> is equivalent to <code>0</code>. Here's how it
                works:</p>

            <p>In this case, the arrays <code>[1, 2]</code> and <code>[1, 2]</code> are converted to strings
                <code>"1,2"</code> and <code>"1,2"</code>, respectively. Then, the <code>+</code> operator concatenates
                these two strings,<code>"1","2"+"1","2"</code> resulting in the string <code>"1,21,2"</code>.

            <p>In JavaScript, <code>NaN</code> (Not-a-Number) is a special value that represents the result of an
                undefined or unrepresentable mathematical operation. Interestingly, <code>NaN</code> is not equal to
                itself according to the strict equality operator (<code>===</code>).</p>

            <h5>68.What is anonymous function in JavaScript</h5>
            Ans -
            An anonymous function in JavaScript is a function that is defined without a name. It's a function
            expression that doesn't have an identifier associated with it. Anonymous functions are often used when
            you need a function for a short, one-time use, and you don't intend to reuse it elsewhere in your code.

            <h5>69.String method in JavaScript</h5>
            Ans -
            JavaScript provides a variety of built-in methods for manipulating and working with strings.
            <ul>
                <li>length: Returns the length (number of characters) of the string.</li>
                <li>indexOf : Returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified search value within the
                    string.</li>
                <li>lastIndexOf : Returns the index of the last occurrence of the specified search value within the
                    string.</li>
                <li>slice : Extracts a portion of the string and returns a new string.</li>
                <li>toUpperCase : Converts the string to uppercase. </li>
                <li>toLowerCase : Converts the string to lowercase</li>

            <h5>70.Definition of JavaScript</h5>
            Ans - an object-oriented computer programming language commonly used to create interactive effects
            within web browsers
            <br>
            JavaScript can be used for Client-side developments as well as Server-side developments. JavaScript is
            both an imperative and declarative type of language. JavaScript contains a standard library of objects,
            like Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements like operators, control structures, and
            statements

        <div class="section-div">
            <h5>71.How to compare two objects in JavaScript?</h5>
            <strong>Ans-</strong>
            <p>Usually, when you compare <em>data types</em> like <code>int</code> and <code>strings</code> in
                JavaScript, you use the equality operators (<code>==</code> and <code>===</code>). However, comparing
                <em>objects</em> with <code>==</code> and <code>===</code> will not work.
            </p>
            <p>To fix this, one option is to stringify both objects and then use the equality operators.</p>
            <h6>Using <code>JSON.stringify()</code></h6>
            <p>We first convert the objects to their stringified version using <code>JSON.stringify()</code> and then
                compare them using <code>===</code>:</p>
            <img src="https://i.ibb.co/4VP7R28/img1.png" class="img-fluid mb-4" alt="">
            If the order of the properties is different, the above method will evaluate as false even though the
            properties are the same:
            <img src="https://i.ibb.co/mth2JJD/img2.png" class="img-fluid mb-4" alt="">
            <h6>Using lodash</h6>
            <p><strong>lodash</strong> is a JavaScript library that offers <code>_.isEqual(value1, value2)</code>, which
                performs a deep comparison between two values to check if they are equivalent.</p>

        <div class="section-div">
            <h5>72.What is InstanceOf Operator in JavaScript?</h5>
            Ans - The instanceof operator in JavaScript is used to determine whether an object is an instance of a
            particular constructor or class. It checks the prototype chain of the object to see if the constructor's
            prototype property exists anywhere in that chain. In other words, it checks if an object inherits from a
            specific constructor's prototype.

        <div class="section-div">
            <h5>73.What is strict mode in JavaScript?</h5>
            Ans - Strict mode in JavaScript is a feature that enforces a stricter set of rules and behaviors for
            writing JavaScript code. When strict mode is enabled, it helps catch common coding mistakes and prevent
            the use of certain error-prone features.

            <h5>74.What is super function in JavaScript?</h5>
            Ans -
            In JavaScript, the super keyword is used to call functions or access properties of a parent class within
            a subclass. It's commonly used in the context of object-oriented programming when working with classes
            and inheritance. The super keyword allows you to access and invoke methods and properties defined in the
            parent class from the subclass.

            <h5>76.What is bind in JavaScript?</h5>
            Ans -
            In JavaScript, the bind() method is used to create a new function with a specific this value and
            optional arguments. It is often used to bind a function to a particular object or context, ensuring that
            the this value inside the function will always refer to the specified object, regardless of how the
            function is called

        <br>
        <div class="section-div">
            <h5>77.What is call by value and call by reference in JavaScript?</h5>
            Ans - In JavaScript, when passing arguments to functions, it's important to understand the concepts of
            "call by value" and "call by reference," although these terms can sometimes be misleading due to the way
            JavaScript handles data types.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h5>Call by Value -</h5>

            In languages that strictly follow call by value, a copy of the actual value of the variable is passed to
            the function. This means that changes made to the parameter within the function do not affect the
            original value outside the function. JavaScript's primitive data types (such as numbers, strings,
            booleans) behave like call by value
            <br>
            <br>
            <h5> Call by Reference -</h5>
            In languages that strictly follow call by reference, a reference or memory address of the variable is
            passed to the function. This means that changes made to the parameter within the function affect the
            original value outside the function. JavaScript's objects (including arrays and functions) behave like
            call by reference.

            <h5>81.Difference between JavaScript and jQuery?</h5>
            Ans -
            <div>
                <h5>JavaScript:-</h5>
                <br>

                <h6>1 Language Nature:</h6>
                JavaScript is a programming language. It is a versatile and widely-used scripting language that can
                be
                used for a variety of purposes, including web development, server-side programming (Node.js), and
                more.

                <h6>2 Execution Environment:</h6>
                JavaScript can run in various environments, including web browsers, servers (Node.js), mobile apps,
                and
                more.

                <h6>3 DOM Manipulation:</h6>
                JavaScript allows direct manipulation of the Document Object Model (DOM), which represents the
                structure
                of a web page. It provides native methods to interact with HTML elements, attributes, and events.

                <h6>4 Learning Curve:</h6>
                Learning JavaScript requires understanding its core concepts, including variables, data types,
                functions, control structures, and object-oriented programming (OOP) principles.

                <h6>5 Browser Compatibility:</h6>
                JavaScript code can sometimes require cross-browser testing and adjustments to ensure compatibility
                across different browsers.
            </div>
            <br>
            <div>
                <h5>jQuery:-</h5>
                <br>
                <h6>Library:</h6>
                jQuery is a JavaScript library. It is not a programming language but rather a set of pre-written
                JavaScript functions and methods packaged in a convenient API.
                <h6>Simplification:</h6>
                jQuery simplifies common tasks in web development, such as DOM manipulation, event handling,
                animations, and AJAX requests. It provides a concise syntax for performing these tasks, often
                requiring less code compared to plain JavaScript.
                <h6>DOM Manipulation:</h6>
                jQuery abstracts and simplifies DOM manipulation, providing a consistent interface across different
                browsers. This can help mitigate some browser compatibility issues.
                <h6>Learning Curve:</h6>
                Learning jQuery is often faster than learning pure JavaScript due to its simplified API. However,
                it's important to have a foundational understanding of JavaScript concepts to use jQuery
                effectively.
                <h6>Browser Compatibility:</h6>
                jQuery handles many browser compatibility issues internally, making it easier to write code that
                works consistently across browsers.
