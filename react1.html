            <strong>Ans:</strong>
            <div class="w3-cell w3-container w3-light-gray w3-border-left w3-cell-top" style="padding:20px;">
                <p>React is a <b>JavaScript</b> library created by <b>Facebook</b></p>
                <p>React is a <b>User Interface</b> (UI) library</p>
                <p>React is a tool for building <b>UI components</b></p>
                <p>React.js, commonly referred to as React, is an open-source JavaScript library used for building user
                    interfaces (UIs) for web and mobile applications.</p>
                <p>React is known for its component-based architecture, which allows developers to create reusable UI
                    components. These components are self-contained and can be combined to build complex user
                    interfaces.</p>

            <h5>2. What is difference between virtual dom and shallow
                dom , dom in React js</h5>
            <strong>Ans:</strong>
            <p><strong>1.Dom(Document Object Model) =></strong>
            <ul>
                <li>The DOM is the actual representation of the structure of an HTML document in a web browser.</li>
                <li>It's a tree-like structure where each HTML element (e.g., div, span, p) is represented as a node in
                    the tree.</li>
                <li>Manipulating the DOM directly in JavaScript can be slow and inefficient. Beacuse it update
                    immediately the real dom</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p><strong>2.Virtual dom(Virtual Document Object Model) =></strong>
            <ul>
                <li>The Virtual DOM is a Copy of actual DOM.</li>
                <li>It's a lightweight, in-memory representation of the actual DOM.</li>
                <li>When you make changes to a component's state or props, React doesn't immediately update the real
                    DOM. Instead, it creates a new Virtual DOM tree that represents what the updated UI should look
                    like.</li>
                <li><strong>React then performs a process called "reconciliation," </strong></li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p><strong>3.Shallow Dom(Shallow Document Object Model) =></strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Shallow DOM is not a widely used React.</li>
                <li>In web components, the Shadow DOM allowing components to have their own isolated DOM tree that
                    doesn't interfere with the rest of the page's DOM</li>
                <li>React doesn't use the Shadow DOM by default. Instead, it relies on the Virtual DOM to manage updates
                    efficiently.</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>3. What is controlled and uncontrolled component in React js</h5>
            <strong>Ans:</strong>
            <p>In React, a <strong>controlled</strong> component is a component that is controlled by React state</p>
            <p> A controlled component is a component that does not maintain any internal state. means form data is
                handled by a React component.</p>

            <p><strong>uncontrolled</strong> component is a component that maintains its own internal state.</p>
            <p>An uncontrolled component is a component that maintains its own internal state. means where form data is
                handled
                by the DOM itself.</p>

        <div class="section-div">
            <h5>4. What is hooks in React js</h5>
            <strong>Ans:</strong>
            <p>Hooks are the new feature introduced in the React 16.8 version. It allows you to use state and other
                React features without writing a class. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section-div">
            <h5>5. What is jsx, babel, webpack</h5>
            <strong>Ans:</strong>
            <p><strong>1. JSX(JavaScript XML): </strong>JSX{} allows us to write HTML in React by converting HTML into
                React component Helping you to more easily create ui for your web Application it is combination of JS
                and HTML</p>
            <p><strong>2. BABLE: </strong>Babel is a JavaScript compiler that allows you to use the latest version of
                JavaScript.Babel can compile JSX code into JavaScript that can be executed in the browser.it can convert
                modern JavaScript (ES6+ syntax) into older versions (ES5) to ensure cross-browser compatibility. </p>

            <p><strong>3. webpack</strong> Webpack is a popular JavaScript module bundler. It helps you manage and
                bundle all the assets and dependencies of your web application, including JavaScript, CSS, images, and
                more.Webpack is often used to bundle the JavaScript code that includes your React components, JSX, and
                other assets.</p>

            <h5>6. What is Redux</h5>
            <strong>Ans:</strong>
            <p>Redux is an open-source JavaScript library used to manage application state. React uses Redux for
                building the user interface</p>
            <p>Redux is a framework used on the frontend of a web application.</p>
            <p>Redux is a predictable state container designed to help you write JavaScript apps that behave
                consistently across client, server, and native environments, and are easy to test.</p>

        <div class="section-div">
            <h5>7. What is reducer , action, store in Redux</h5>
            <strong>Ans:</strong>
            <p><strong>Store:- </strong>The central piece of Redux is the store, which holds the entire state tree of
                the application. This state is typically represented as a JavaScript object. Accessing and updating the
                state is done through the store's API.</p>
            <p><strong>Action:- </strong>Actions(logic and calculation) are plain JavaScript objects that describe an
                event or an intention to change the state. They must have a <strong>`type`</strong> property that
                indicates the type of action being performed. </p>
            <p><strong>Reducer:- </strong>Reducers are pure functions that take the current state and an action (logic
                and calculation) as arguments and return a new state. </p>

        <div class="section-div">
            <h5>8. What is middleware in Redux</h5>
            <strong>Ans:</strong>
            <p><strong>A Redux middleware</strong> is a function returning a function, which takes next as a
                parameter. Then the inner function returns another function which takes action
                as a parameter and finally returns next(action).</p>

            <h5>9. Explain data flow in Redux</h5>
            <strong>Ans:</strong>
            <p>Redux follows the unidirectional data flow. It means that your application data will follow in one-way
                binding data flow.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Action Dispatch</strong>:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The data flow begins when an action is dispatched. Actions are plain JavaScript objects that
                            describe an event or an intention to change the state.</li>
                        <li>Each action must have a <code>type</code> property that defines the type of action being
                            performed. Additional data, often referred to as the "payload,".</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Reducers</strong>:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reducers are pure functions responsible for handling the state updates based on the
                            dispatched action.</li>
                        <li>When an action is dispatched, all registered reducers are called.</li>
                        <li>Each reducer takes the current state and the action as arguments and returns a new state
                            object.</li>
                        <li>Reducers must not modify the existing state but create a new state object that reflects the
                            changes.</li>
                        <li>Reducers typically use a <code>switch</code> statement to determine how to update the state
                            based on the action's <code>type</code>.</li>
                    </ul>

                <li>
                    <p><strong>Store Update</strong>:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>After all reducers have been executed, the new state returned by each reducer is combined
                            into a single state object.</li>
                        <li>This new state object becomes the updated state of the Redux store.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>UI Component Updates</strong>:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>React components that are connected to the Redux store through the <code>connect</code>
                            function (provided by the React-Redux library) receive updates when the state in the Redux
                            store changes.</li>
                        <li>These components can specify which parts of the state they are interested in using
                            selectors. Selectors are functions that extract specific data from the application state.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Render UI</strong>:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>When a component receives updated state from the store, it re-renders with the new data.
                        </li>
                        <li>Components are re-rendered efficiently, as React uses a virtual DOM to determine the minimal
                            changes needed to update the actual DOM.</li>
                    </ul>

                <li>
                    <p><strong>User Interaction</strong>:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>User interactions with the UI, such as clicking buttons or entering text, can trigger new
                            actions to be dispatched.</li>
                        <li>This starts the data flow cycle again, with new actions being dispatched, processed by
                            reducers, and resulting in updated state.</li>

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>State Management</strong>: Class components can manage their own internal state
                                using the <code>this.state</code> object. State changes trigger component re-renders.
                            </p>

                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Lifecycle Methods</strong>: Class components have access to lifecycle methods
                                such as <code>componentDidMount</code>, <code>componentDidUpdate</code>, and
                                <code>componentWillUnmount</code>. These methods are used for side effects, data
                                fetching, and cleanup operations.

                                <code>useState</code> hook, introduced in React 16.8. Hooks allow functional components
                                to manage state and other React features previously available only in class components.

            <h5>13. How can we implement componentWillUnmount in function component</h5>
            <strong>Ans:</strong>
            <p>In function components in React, you can't use <code>componentWillUnmount</code> directly because it's
                part of the class component lifecycle. Instead, you can achieve the same cleanup behavior using the
                <code>useEffect</code> hook. Here's how you can implement the equivalent of
                <code>componentWillUnmount</code> in a function component:
            </p>

            <p><strong>When Does <code>useEffect</code> Run</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>No Dependency Array</strong>: If you pass an empty dependency array (<code>[]</code>)
                        as the second argument, the effect runs once after the initial render. It's equivalent to
                        the behavior of <code>componentDidMount</code> in class components.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>With Dependencies</strong>: If you provide an array of dependencies, the effect will
                        run whenever any of the dependencies change. This allows you to control when the effect runs
                        based on specific state or prop changes. It's similar to <code>componentDidUpdate</code> in
                        class components.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>No Second Argument</strong>: If you omit the second argument, the effect runs after
                        every render, which is often not what you want. It's equivalent to not using
                        <code>shouldComponentUpdate</code> in class components.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>


            <p><strong>Cleanup</strong>:
            <ul>
                <li> You can return a cleanup function from the effect. This function is called when the component is
                    unmounted or when the dependencies change before the next effect run. It allows you to clean up any
                    resources or subscriptions to prevent memory leaks.</p>
                </li>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Purpose</strong>: <code>useEffect</code> is used for managing side effects in your
                    functional components. Side effects include data fetching, DOM manipulation, subscriptions, and
                    more.</li>

                <li><strong>Usage</strong>:<ul>
                        <li>The first argument is a function containing the side effect code.</li>
                        <li>The optional second argument is an array of dependencies. When any of these dependencies
                            change, the effect is re-run.</li>
                        <li>The function can return a cleanup function, which will be executed before the next effect or
                            when the component unmounts.</li>
                    </ul>

            <h5>16. What is difference between export default and export in React js</h5>
            <strong>Ans:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p><strong><code>export default</code></strong>:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>When you use <code>export default</code>, you are exporting a single value or object as the
                            default export for your module.</li>
                        <li>There can be only one default export per module.</li>
                        <li>You can give the default export any name you want when importing it in another module.</li>
                        <li>Default exports are commonly used for exporting the main or primary functionality of a
                            module.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>When you use <code>export</code>, you are exporting one or more named exports. You can have
                            multiple named exports in a single module.</li>
                        <li>Named exports require you to specify the name when importing them in another module.</li>
                        <li>Named exports are useful for exporting multiple values, functions, or objects from a module.
