            <p><b>Ans:</b>
            <ol>
                <li><b>cell spacing</b>: Cell spacing refers to the amount of space between adjacent cells in an HTML
                    table. It is used to create gaps or margins between cells, making the table easier to read and
                    visually separating the content. </li>
                <li><b>cell padding?</b>: Cell padding, on the other hand, refers to the space between the content
                    inside a cell and the cell's border. It is used to add internal spacing, so the content doesn't
                    touch the cell's edges, improving readability and aesthetics</li>

            <h5>43 Explain SDLC? </h5>
            <p><b>Ans:</b> Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a process used by the software industry to design,
                develop and test high quality softwares. The SDLC aims to produce a high-quality software that meets or
                exceeds customer expectations </p>
            <p>SDLC is a process followed for a software project, within a software organization. It consists of a
                detailed plan describing how to develop, maintain, replace and alter or enhance specific software. The
                life cycle defines a methodology for improving the quality of software and the overall development
                process</p>

            <h5>44 What is wireframe </h5>
            <p><b>Ans:</b> A wireframe is a visual representation or blueprint of a web page, mobile app, or software
                interface that outlines the basic structure and layout of the user interface (UI). It is a low-fidelity,
                simplified design that focuses on the placement of key elements such as buttons, navigation, text
                fields, images, and other UI components </p>
            <p>Wireframes can be created using various tools, such as pen and paper, whiteboards, specialized design
                software, or online wireframe tools. They are especially helpful during the initial stages of a project
                as they allow for rapid prototyping,</p>

            <h5>45 What is difference between HTML and XHTML </h5>
            <p><b>Ans:</b>XHTML can be considered as a part of the XML markup language this is because of XHTML have
                features of both XML and HTML. XHTML is extended from XML and HTML. XHTML can be considered as a better
                version of HTML</p>
            <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and XHTML (Extensible Hypertext Markup Language) are both markup
                languages used to structure the content of web pages. However, there are some key differences between
                the two:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p> <b>Syntax:</b></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>HTML: HTML has a more lenient syntax, allowing for some sloppy coding practices and optional
                            elements. For example, in HTML, you can omit end tags for certain elements like
                            <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>, and attributes can be specified without
                            quotes.
                        </li>
                        <li>XHTML: XHTML follows the strict XML rules, which means that all elements must be properly
                            nested and closed with end tags. Attributes must be quoted, and XHTML documents must have a
                            valid XML declaration.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><b>Parsing:</b></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>HTML: HTML parsers are generally more forgiving and can handle malformed code more
                            gracefully. Browsers can often interpret and display the content even if the code is not
                            entirely correct.</li>
                        <li>XHTML: XHTML requires well-formed XML, and even minor errors can cause the document to fail
                            to load or display properly. It has a stricter parsing process, and errors are not as
                            forgiving as in HTML.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><b>Case Sensitivity:</b></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>HTML: HTML is not case sensitive for tag and attribute names. For example,
                            <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;DIV&gt;</code> are treated the same.
                        </li>
                        <li>XHTML: XHTML is case sensitive, so <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;DIV&gt;</code> are
                            considered different elements.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><b>MIME Type:</b></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>HTML: The MIME type for HTML is "text/html".</li>
                        <li>XHTML: The MIME type for XHTML is "application/xhtml+xml".</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><b>Use of Self-Closing Tags:</b></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>HTML: In HTML, some elements can use self-closing syntax, such as <code>&lt;br&gt;</code>,
                            <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>.
                        </li>
                        <li>XHTML: In XHTML, all elements must be explicitly closed, even those that are self-contained,
                            like <code>&lt;br /&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;img /&gt;</code>, and
                            <code>&lt;input /&gt;</code>.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><b>Browser Support:</b></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>HTML: HTML has been supported by browsers for a long time, and all modern browsers fully
                            support HTML documents.</li>
                        <li>XHTML: Although XHTML is based on XML, not all browsers fully support it with the
                            "application/xhtml+xml" MIME type. Browsers generally treat XHTML documents as HTML if
                            served with the "text/html" MIME type.</li>
                    </ul>

            <p><b>Ans:</b> Semantic means "relating to meaning".Semantic HTML tags are tags that define the meaning of
                the content they contain. ex: header , main , and footer tags are semantic because they are used to
                represent different sections on an HTML page </p>

            <h5>50 what is the use of name attribute in input? </h5>
            <p><b>Ans:</b> The "name" attribute in an HTML input element is used to identify the input field when it is
                submitted to the server as part of a form. It provides a name for the input field, which is sent as a
                key-value pair to the server when the form is submitted. </p>
            <p>The "name" attribute is particularly important when you have multiple input fields within a form and you
                want to access the values entered by users on the server-side. Each input field should have a unique
                "name" attribute so that the server can distinguish between them.</p>

            <h5>51 why it is better to copy fonts from google fonts? </h5>
            <p><b>Ans:</b> </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Legal and Licensing >></b> Google Fonts provides fonts that are free to use, and they offer them
                    under open-source licenses. This means you can use the fonts for personal or commercial projects
                    without worrying about legal issues related to font licensing.</li>
                <li><b>Performance >></b> Google Fonts uses a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to serve fonts. CDNs are

            <h5>52 why we use fontawesome icons instead of images? </h5>
            <p><b>Ans:</b> Font Awesome icons are often preferred over traditional image icons for several reasons</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Scalability</strong>: Font Awesome icons are vector-based, which means they can be easily
                        scaled to any size without losing quality. Whether you display the icon at a small size in a
                        navigation menu or a large size in a hero section, it will look crisp and clear.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Loading Speed</strong>: Font Awesome icons are loaded as fonts, and they are typically
                        smaller in file size compared to image files. Using fonts for icons can lead to faster page
                        loading times, which is crucial for improving user experience and search engine rankings.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Customizable</strong>: Font Awesome icons are highly customizable through CSS. You can
                        change the color, size, and even add effects like shadows or animations without needing to
                        create new image files for each variation.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Consistency</strong>: Font Awesome provides a consistent set of icons with a unified
                        design style. When you use image icons, it can be challenging to maintain a consistent look
                        across different icons, especially if they come from different sources or designers.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Cross-browser Compatibility</strong>: Font Awesome icons work across various browsers,
                        including older versions, ensuring a consistent experience for all users.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Access to a Large Library</strong>: Font Awesome offers a vast library of icons covering
                        various categories, making it easy to find icons suitable for different purposes without the
                        need to create or search for individual image icons.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Accessibility</strong>: When used correctly with proper semantic markup, Font Awesome
                        icons can be made accessible to screen readers and assistive technologies, ensuring a better
                        experience for users with disabilities.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Easy Implementation</strong>: Implementing Font Awesome is straightforward. You only need
                        to include the Font Awesome CSS file and use the corresponding HTML tags or CSS classes to add
                        icons to your website or application.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Reduced HTTP Requests</strong>: Using Font Awesome reduces the number of HTTP requests on
                        your website because all icons are loaded from a single font file, unlike image icons that
                        require individual HTTP requests for each file.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Icon Font Support</strong>: Many web designers and developers are familiar with using
                        icon fonts, making Font Awesome a popular choice due to its ease of use and integration into
                        existing workflows.</p>

            <h5>53 can you add multiple id to single element?  </h5>
            <p><b>Ans:</b> No, you cannot add multiple "id" attributes to a single HTML element. The "id" attribute is meant to uniquely identify an element within an HTML document. According to the HTML specification, the "id" attribute must be unique on the page, and no two elements should have the same "id" value. </p>

            <p><b>Ans:</b> </p>
<div class="markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert light"><p>Canvas and SVG are two different technologies used in web development for creating graphics and visual elements, but they have some fundamental differences in their approach and use cases:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Drawing Methodology:</strong></p><ul><li>Canvas: Canvas is a bitmap-based approach where you work with pixels directly. It uses JavaScript to draw graphics on a fixed-size bitmap. Each element drawn on the canvas is essentially a collection of pixels, and once drawn, they are not retained as separate objects. If you want to manipulate or animate elements, you need to redraw them.</li><li>SVG: SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is a vector-based approach that uses XML to define graphical elements. Instead of working with pixels, SVG uses geometric shapes, paths, and curves to represent objects. This means that SVG elements are scalable and retain their sharpness and clarity regardless of the size they are displayed at. SVG elements can also be easily manipulated and animated using CSS and JavaScript.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Resolution and Scalability:</strong></p><ul><li>Canvas: Canvas has a fixed resolution, and if you scale the canvas, the pixels will be scaled, which can lead to pixelation and loss of quality.</li><li>SVG: SVG is resolution-independent and can be scaled infinitely without losing quality. This makes it ideal for graphics that need to adapt to different screen sizes or resolutions.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Interactivity:</strong></p><ul><li>Canvas: While you can add interactivity to a canvas by using JavaScript, each drawn element on the canvas is essentially a flat image, and you need to handle events manually.</li><li>SVG: SVG elements are accessible in the DOM (Document Object Model), which means they can be easily manipulated and interacted with using CSS and JavaScript. SVG elements can also respond to events directly.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Complexity and Animation:</strong></p><ul><li>Canvas: Canvas is better suited for complex animations and real-time rendering, such as video games or data visualizations, where you need to redraw elements frequently and efficiently.</li><li>SVG: SVG is better for static or simple animations, such as icons, charts, or illustrations. Since SVG elements are retained in the DOM, complex animations with many elements might become inefficient and impact performance.</li></ul></li></ol></div>
